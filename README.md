# Welcome to my Repository

#### This is my final year project which is on designing and developing an autonomous Pan Tilt Surveillance Camera with the use of object detection. It's basically a camera that moves in dual axes and so it eliminates blindspots and with the use of object detection, it is made autonomous by detecting objects in view specifically persons and then tracks and follows that person. The video feed is displayed on a GUI which is also used for controlling the movements manually.

## Contents of this Repo

#### This repo contains the images used to makeup the control buttons for the GUI, a motor file for controlling the motor movements and a GUI file which contains the object detection also.
